  Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
  Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
  Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
  Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally
  required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental
  requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in
  response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public
  authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).

  Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.
  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

  4. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

        </Text>
  In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
  We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.
